# Deadline Tracker Web App

## Project Overview

This web app is designed to be a fantastic productivity tool, helping students stay organized and on top of their academic deadlines for assignments and quizzes.

The vision for this app includes:

  * **Clean dashboard** showing upcoming deadlines at a glance.
  * Ability to **add/edit assignments and quizzes** with due dates, subjects, and priority levels.
  * A **visual calendar view** to see deadlines across time.
  * **Progress tracking** to easily mark items as completed.
  * **Smart filtering** by subject, deadline proximity, or completion status.

For the design, the focus is on a modern, student-friendly interface featuring:

  * **Color-coded priority levels** (high/medium/low).
  * **Intuitive card-based layout** for easy scanning.
  * **Smooth animations** and hover effects for a better user experience.
  * **Responsive design** that works seamlessly on all devices.
  * **Clean typography** and plenty of whitespace for readability.

The chosen color scheme is vibrant yet professional, utilizing blues and greens for a calming yet productive feel, complemented by subtle gradients and shadows for depth.
